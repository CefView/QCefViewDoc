# Change CEF version

If you want to change the version of CEF binary distribution, please follow the instructions:

## 1. Find Target Version

Find the target version you want from the CEF Automated Builds website: https://cef-builds.spotifycdn.com/index.html.

## 2. Modify QCefConfig.cmake

Change the download URL in the [CefConfig.cmake](https://github.com/CefView/CefViewCore/blob/3ba46626d9739bd6266356828400ca1de41c1f20/CefConfig.cmake) file.

Normally you just need to change the first line command:
> set(CEF_SDK_VERSION "cef_binary_89.0.12+g2b76680+chromium-89.0.4389.90")

set the **`CEF_SDK_VERSION`** to the target version you want.

## 3. Build QCefView

Build QCefView project as the instructions described in previous section.

> **âš  WARNING: If you choose a very early CEF version or a brand new one which introduces breaking changes, you may need to adapt the [CefViewCore](https://github.com/CefView/CefViewCore) repo to the target version manually.**
